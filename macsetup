# This script is intended to carry out some basic workspace environments done to my Mac
# Includes settings for JUPYTER NOTEBOOK and some KARABINER REMAPS.
# Try to store as many as possible here so switching to a new laptop will be more painless
# Issues:
# * Some settings are read from notebook.json, but the notebook has to be created
#   after editing (or perhaps COPIED; try that out).
# * Some settings are never ever read; currently seems to be just menu options but
#   not sure of pattern. Needs more testing
# * Post issue to jupyter notebook.

# Use the below for user response
# read -p "Overwrite current jupyter notebook settings?" -n 1 -r
# echo # move to new line
# [[ "$REPLY" =~ "^[Yy]$" ]]

# Enable the complex Karabiner remap that allows switching hyphen and underscore keys
# See this Issues page: https://github.com/tekezo/Karabiner-Elements/issues/329
# GUI instructions: Go to "Complex Modifications" in Karabiner prefs and "Add Rule"
