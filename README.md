## The dotfiles repo
This syncs various tools/plugins/settings for for `bash`, `vim`, `tmux`, and `jupyter`, along with some `bin` scripts.

Check out the `nc<suffix>` functions in my `.bashrc` for a bunch of super useful tools that parse `ncdump` output/summarize NetCDF files. You will also find some handy tools for maintaining connections to remote `jupyter notebook` sessions.
Check out `.vimrc` for my plugin usage and some handy functions and remaps, and check out my repositories starting with `vim-` for some handy custom plugins.
Try out my `.dircolors.ansi` for useful color-coding of `ls` results. Try out my `.gitconfig` for a few handy `git` aliases.

The `.jupyter` folder is synced just to preserve my custom key bindings in `notebook.json`, along with some `nbextension` settings in `tree.json`, `common.json`, and `jupyter_notebook_config.json`.
<!-- The `custom` folder contains custom javascript and CSS files controlled by `jupyterthemes`.  -->
