## The dotfiles repo
This syncs my settings for `bash`, `vim`, `tmux`, `screen`, and some limited `python` settings.

Good idea to keep separate installations of **`anaconda`** at least, because for example
compiling the ISCA module must be complicated if the distro is shared by two servers with different utilities.

The case of `.jupyter` and `.ipython` stuff is more tricky. Perhaps this will store keyboard shortcuts? It will
save the themes generated by `jt` as custom `.css` files, but notebook themes can just be enabled on startup by
default with a simple alias. Really we just want to sync some extra tools, perhaps there is better way.
