# dotfiles
This syncs various tools/plugins/settings for for `bash`, `vim`, `tmux`, and `jupyter`, along with some `bin` scripts.

## Bash config
Check out the `nc<suffix>` functions in my `.bashrc` for a bunch of super useful tools that parse `ncdump` output/summarize NetCDF files. You will also find some handy tools for maintaining connections to remote `jupyter notebook` sessions.
Try out my `.dircolors.ansi` for useful color-coding of `ls` results. 

## Vim config
Check out `.vimrc` for my plugin usage and some handy functions and remaps. Instead of
just using `<Leader>` for custom maps, I use three different keys for custom
map prefixes: `<Tab>`, `\`, and `<Space>`. The first one is used for window and tab
management shortcuts, the second one for complex regexs replacements and tabular
alignment, and the third for miscellaneous tasks.
Also check out my repositories starting with `vim-` for some handy custom plugins.

## Try out my `.dircolors.ansi` for useful color-coding of `ls` results. Git config
Try out my `.gitconfig` for a few handy `git` aliases. Also see the
various functions in `bin`.

## Jupyter config
The `.jupyter` folder is synced just to preserve my custom key bindings in `notebook.json`, along with some `nbextension` settings in `tree.json`, `common.json`, and `jupyter_notebook_config.json`.
<!-- The `custom` folder contains custom javascript and CSS files controlled by `jupyterthemes`.  -->
