ABSTRACT
A new analysis of sea-surface temperature (SST) observations indicates notable uncertainty in observed decadal climate variability in the second half of
the 20th century, particularly during the decades following World War II. The
uncertainties are revealed by exploring SST data binned separately for the two
predominant measurement types: "engine-room intake" (ERI) and "bucket"
measurements. ERI measurements indicate large decreases in global-mean
SSTs from 1950 to 1975, whereas "bucket" measurements indicate increases
in SST over this period before bias adjustments are applied but decreases after
they are applied. The trends in the bias adjustments applied to the "bucket"
data are larger than the global-mean trends during the period 1950-1975, and
thus the global-mean trends during this period derive largely from the adjustments themselves. This is critical, since the adjustments are based on incomplete information about the underlying measurement methods, and are thus
subject to considerable uncertainty. The uncertainty in decadal-scale variability is particularly pronounced over the North Pacific, where the sign of lowfrequency variability through the 1950s-1970s is different for each measurement type. The uncertainty highlighted here has important - but in our view
widely overlooked - implications for the interpretation of observed decadal
climate variability over both the Pacific and Atlantic basins during the midto-late 20th century.

Capsule Summary30

Biases in sea-surface temperature observations lead to larger uncertainties in our understanding31
of mid-to-late 20th century climate variability than previously thought.32

1. Introduction33

The world ocean warmed by ,0.75K from 1900-2016, but the warming did not occur monoton-34
ically: temperatures increased during the first half of the 20th century, decreased slightly during35
the decades following World War II, and increased rapidly after ,1975 (Hartmann et al. 2013).36
The decreases in ocean temperatures from the 1950s-1970s are apparent in SSTs averaged over37
the globe and both the Atlantic and Pacific sectors (Figures 1k-o, black time series; Figures 2k-o,38
black bars).39

The absence of warming during the decades following World War II is important because it co-40
incides with steadily increasing concentrations of carbon dioxide over the same period. Several41
theories have been proposed to explain the absence of warming during this period, including in-42
creases in atmospheric sulfate aerosols (Tett et al. 2002; Lamarque et al. 2010; Booth et al. 2012;43
Myhre et al. 2013; Folland et al. 2018) and decadal variability in the ocean (Delworth and Mann44
2000; Baines and Folland 2007; Knight et al. 2006; Semenov et al. 2010). Here we provide novel45
analyses of SST data separated into the two primary measurement sources to demonstrate that the46
uncertainty in decadal variability of SST from the 1950s-1970s is at least as large as the observed47
decadal variability itself. The results highlight the critical importance of considering uncertainty48
in SST observations in analyses of observed decadal climate variability.49

SST data during the period after 1980 are derived from several in situ and remotely-sensed50
sources (Kent et al. 2010; Kennedy et al. 2011b). But SST data prior to 1980 are derived almost51
entirely from two in situ sources via "ships of opportunity": 1) the temperature of seawater in52

3

buckets that have been submerged below the ocean surface and then hauled back onto a ship53
deck (bucket measurements); and 2) the temperature of the pumped water supply to an engine54
room (engine-room intake or ERI measurements) (Kent et al. 2010; Kennedy et al. 2011b). A55
comparatively small number of hull sensor observations are also included in the ERI category, as56
the biases in both hull sensor and ERI data are thought to be governed by similar factors (Kennedy57
et al. 2011b).58

Bucket and ERI measurements both exhibit substantial measurement biases (Kent and Kaplan59
2006; Rayner et al. 2006; Kent et al. 2010; Kennedy et al. 2011b; Kent et al. 2017; Folland and60
Parker 1995). ERI measurements are often warm-biased due to the transfer of heat from the61
superstructure of the ship as water passes through pipes, while bucket measurements are often62
cold-biased due to the exchange of latent and sensible heat with the surrounding air. If the mix of63
measurement types and their relative biases are well understood, then the biases can be adjusted so64
that they have little effect on the time evolution of spatially-averaged temperature data. But if the65
mix of measurement types is poorly documented, large biases can remain after adjustment, even66
in widely used climate data sources (Folland and Parker 1995; Thompson et al. 2008; Karl et al.67
2015).68

In principle, SST data stratified by measurement type provide the opportunity to assess the69
reproducibility of SST variability in subsets of the data not influenced by changes to instrumenta-70
tion. With this in mind, the UK Met Office Hadley Centre developed SST datasets stratified into71
bucket and ERI measurements in conjunction with the release of their most recent gridded dataset72
HadSST3 (Kennedy et al. 2011a,b). The bucket and ERI data are available over the period 1946-73
2006, and were developed in the same way as the full HadSST3 dataset (Kennedy et al. 2011a,b);74
that is, by 1) estimating the measurement types of SST observations in the International Compre-75
hensive Ocean-Atmosphere Data Set release 2.5 archive (ICOADS2.5; Woodruff et al. (2011)); 2)76

4

consolidating the observations onto monthly 5ffi*5ffi grids; 3) applying bias adjustment schemes77
unique to each measurement type; and 4) accounting for parametric uncertainty in the bias ad-78
justment schemes by generating 100 plausible realizations of the adjustments. For each of the79
bucket-only and ERI-only datasets, observations estimated to be from the other measurement type80
were ignored, and for this analysis, grid boxes without valid data from the other measurement type81
were excluded. The latter step ensures that the bucket-only and ERI-only data are "co-located," or82
have the same spatial coverage through time at the grid box level. This is critical, as measurement83
types are often distributed differently across each ocean basin (Kent and Taylor 2006).84

The identification of SST methodology is imperfect; in many cases, the ICOADS2.5 metadata85
does not provide specific information about the measurement method, and hence the measurement86
type must be estimated from other information, such as country of origin (Kennedy et al. 2011b).87
Even if the measurement type is indicated by the metadata, the indication is sometimes incor-88
rect (Kent et al. 2007). In other cases, the general type of measurement is known (e.g., bucket),89
but specific aspects of the measurement (e.g., the construction and insulation of the bucket) are90
not. Nevertheless, the bucket-only and ERI-only datasets reflect the best available estimates of91
mid-20th century SST variability minimally influenced by changes to instrumentation. Together,92
the two datasets thus provide a unique opportunity to explore uncertainty in observed decadal93
variability.94

2. The Problem95

The unadjusted bucket and ERI data yield remarkably different renditions of 20th century SST96
variability, particularly prior to ,1975 (red and blue time series in Figs 1a-e; red and blue bars97
in Figs 2a-e; Figs 3a and 3b). For example, the ERI data exhibit cooling of the Pacific ocean98
from 1950-1975, whereas the unadjusted bucket data indicate warming (Figs 1d-e; Figs 2d-e; Figs99

5

3a and 3b). Likewise, the ERI data exhibit cooling in the global average over the same period,100
whereas the bucket data indicate warming (Figs 1a, 2a).101

The adjustments applied to the ERI data using the HadSST3 bias adjustment scheme are mostly102
stationary in time, with the exception of the short-term bias adjustments applied to the Atlantic103
sector during the early 1990s (red time series in Figs 1f-j; see Kent and Kaplan (2006)). Hence104
they do not notably affect estimates of decadal variability (red bars in Figs 2f-j; Fig. 3d). In105
contrast, the adjustments applied to the bucket data introduce a substantial 0.1K/decade cooling106
over the period 1950 to 1975 (blue time series in Figs 1f-j; blue bars in Figs 2f-j; Fig. 3e), due107
to the assumed transition from canvas to rubber buckets (Kent et al. 2010; Kennedy et al. 2011b).108
The cooling introduced by the adjustments applied to the bucket data ranges from -0.05 to -0.15109
K/decade across the 100 realizations of the HadSST3 bias adjustments (error bars in Figs 2f-j).110
The adjusted bucket temperature data exhibit robust cooling in Atlantic basin averages but not in111
the global and Pacific basin averages. The Atlantic cooling is apparent in all 100 realizations of112
the adjusted bucket data (whiskers on blue bars in Figs 2l-m) and is also statistically significant113
with respect to the detrended variability in the data (Figs S1l-m, Supplemental Materials). The114
adjustments for both ERI and bucket data are roughly stationary in time during the 1976-2006115
period (Figs 4d-f).116

The resulting adjusted ERI and bucket data (red and blue time series in Figs 1k-o; red and117
blue bars in Figs 2k-o; Figs 3g-h) are in closer agreement with each other than their unadjusted118
counterparts. However, the trends in the SST field over the period 1950-1975 are still notably119
different for the two measurement types. In the global-average, the cooling in the adjusted bucket120
data is roughly half as large as the cooling in the adjusted ERI data (Figs 1k, 2k). The discrepancies121
are especially notable in the Pacific sector, where the adjusted ERI data exhibit cooling over the122
period 1950-1975 but the adjusted bucket data exhibit relatively little change in temperature (Figs123

6

1n-o; Figs 2n-o; Figs 3g-h). In contrast, over the Atlantic sector the adjusted ERI data exhibit124
significantly weaker cooling than the adjusted bucket data (Figs 1l-m; Figs 2l-m; Figs 3g-h).125
These patterns of disagreement are stronger in the North Pacific and North Atlantic during boreal126
winter (Figs S2l-m, Figs S3g-h; Supplemental Materials).127

After 1975, the agreement between the ERI and bucket data improves as the magnitude of the128
adjustments decreases and the overall quality and consistency of the observations increases. Nev-129
ertheless there remain notable differences in the adjusted ERI and bucket SST trends over the130
1976-2006 period, especially over the south-central Pacific sector (Figs 4g-i) and during austral131
winter (Figs S4g-i, Supplemental Materials).132

Importantly, the amplitudes of the trends in the adjusted ERI and bucket data over the 1950-1975133
period are comparable to the differences between them (compare the red and blue bars with the134
pink bars in Figs 2k-o, and Figs 3g-h with Fig. 3i), which points to the scale of the uncertainty135
in the adjusted data. As indicated by the whiskers on the pink bars in Figs 2k-o and the stippling136
in Fig. 3i, the 100 bias adjustment realizations cannot account for these differences, and thus do137
not entirely characterize the bias uncertainties in the trends. When averaged over large spatial138
domains, the amplitudes of the trends are also comparable to the trends in the bias adjustments139
themselves (compare the middle and bottom rows of Fig. 2). This is key, as the bias adjustment140
schemes are subject to considerable uncertainty, particularly prior to 1980 (Kennedy et al. 2011b;141
Kent et al. 2017).142

In the case of HadSST3, the bias adjustment schemes are derived from metadata contained in143
ICOADS2.5 and historical documentation (Kennedy et al. 2011b). However, the metadata are144
frequently incomplete, and thus various sources of bias are not known with confidence, including145
bucket type, the speed of the ship, the depth from which water for the engine-room is drawn, and146
whether a datum is derived from a bucket or ERI measurement in the first place (Kent and Taylor147

7

2006; Kent et al. 2017). For example, the HadSST3 bias adjustments assume 40-80% of the SST148
data from 1960-1980 are derived from bucket measurements, whereas a recent reassessment of149
measurement type suggests the fraction of bucket measurements over this time is consistently150
closer to 40% (Carella et al. 2018).151

The uncertainties in the bias adjustment scheme applied to HadSST3 data can be inferred from152
the time series in Fig. 1 as follows (see also Kent et al. (2017) and Carella et al. (2018)). The153
unadjusted ERI and bucket time series can be decomposed as:154

ERIunadjusted = ERItrue + ERItrue bias (1)

Bunadjusted = Btrue + Btrue bias (2)

where ERItrue and Btrue are the "true" SST data in the absence of measurement bias, and ERItrue bias155
and Btrue bias are the "ideal" bias adjustments. Since the bucket and ERI data used here are co-156
located in space, it follows that ERItrue = Btrue over area averages large enough to suppress sam-157
pling and measurement uncertainties (Kennedy et al. 2011a; Carella et al. 2018), and therefore158

ERIunadjusted - Bunadjusted = ERItrue bias - Btrue bias (3)
The uncertainty in the bias adjustments applied to the bucket and ERI data (and hence to the159
HadSST3 dataset) can thus be estimated by comparing (a) the differences between the unadjusted160
ERI and bucket data with (b) the differences between the ERI and bucket bias estimates (i.e., the161
negative of the ERI and bucket bias adjustments). If the bias adjustments are ideal, then the time162
series given by (a) and (b) should be identical. Note that the time series can also be identical163
if there is a common bias in the ERI and bucket measurements; the series being identical is a164
necessary but not sufficient criterion for ideal adjustments.165

Fig. 5 shows the results of the above calculation for the domains considered in Figs 1-2. The166
orange lines indicate the differences between the ERI and bucket bias estimates averaged over all167

8

100 pairs of adjustments (the range given by the 100 realizations is indicated by orange shading);168
the black lines indicate the differences between the unadjusted ERI and bucket data. Again, (1)169
if the bias adjustments are ideal, then the black and orange lines should overlie each other, and170
(2) if the 100 realizations of the bias adjustments characterize the uncertainty in the adjustments,171
then the black lines should lie within the regions of orange shading. Overall, the adjustments172
required to bring ERI and bucket data into agreement (black lines) are clearly much larger and173
much more variable than the mean of the actual bias adjustments applied to the HadSST3 data.174
The inferred uncertainties in the bias adjustments are comparable to the amplitude of the observed175
decadal variability in the SST field.176

The uncertainties in decadal-scale variability indicated in Figs 1-5 also affect the two other ma-177
jor historical SST data sets based on the ICOADS2.5 archive: the Centennial in situ Observation-178
Based Estimates of SST (COBE-SST2; Hirahara et al. (2013)) developed by the Japanese Meteo-179
rological Agency, and version 4 of the Extended Reconstructed SST dataset (ERSST4; Huang et al.180
(2014) and Liu et al. (2014)) released by the US National Climatic Data Center. The ERSSTv4 and181
COBE-SST2 datasets are included to provide a point of comparison with SST data that employ182
very different bias correction schemes: The bias adjustments applied in HadSST3 and COBE-183
SST2 are both based on information about measurement type as inferred from the metadata; the184
adjustments applied in ERSST4 are based only on comparisons with night-time marine air tem-185
perature (NMAT) data, which require their own bias adjustments (Rayner et al. 2003; Kent et al.186
2013; Kennedy 2014). In general, over the 1950-1975 period, the trends in the bias-adjusted187
COBE-SST2 data are similar to those in the HadSST3 data, whereas the trends in the bias-adjusted188
NMAT and ERSST4 data are somewhat weaker than those in the HadSST3 data, particularly over189
the Atlantic Ocean and in the global-mean (Figs 2k-o; see Methods for details of the analysis).190

3. So What?191

The results shown here reveal a level of regional uncertainty in observed SSTs that is not widely192
acknowledged in the climate dynamics literature. In our view, it should be. Confidence in observed193
decadal variability derives from confidence in the bias adjustments applied to the SST data. And194
as shown here, the uncertainty in the bias adjustment schemes is frequently comparable to the195
amplitude of the observed decadal variability itself. The uncertainty has important implications for196
our understanding of the role of aerosols in 20th century climate change (Tett et al. 2002; Lamarque197
et al. 2010; Booth et al. 2012; Myhre et al. 2013; Folland et al. 2018), since aerosols are believed198
to have contributed to the absence of global warming during the mid 20th century (Kobayashi199
et al. 2015; Laloyaux et al. 2017; Taylor et al. 2011; Flato et al. 2013). It also has important200
implications for quantifying the amplitudes of patterns of decadal-scale variability, particularly201
over the problematic North Pacific sector (Fig. 1 and 2), and in association with Pacific and202
Atlantic decadal variability (Mantua et al. 1997; Mantua and Hare 2002; Newman et al. 2016;203
Delworth and Mann 2000; Baines and Folland 2007; Knight et al. 2006; Semenov et al. 2010).204

The findings indicate notable shortcomings in our ability to accurately classify SST measure-205
ment methods and to quantify the associated biases. Complicating matters is that measurement206
biases vary not only from one measurement method to the next, but also within the individual207
methods: ERI biases can vary between individual ships and recruiting countries (Kent et al. 1993);208
bucket biases depend on the bucket type, and the transition from canvas to rubber buckets for a209
given recruiting country is highly uncertain (Kennedy et al. 2011b). Additionally, the metadata210
necessary to identify ships is often missing from ICOADS (Carella et al. 2018), and the propor-211
tions of recruiting countries can change substantially over time, especially before ,1970 (Fig. S5,212
Supplemental Materials; Thompson et al. (2008)). For example, the large differences between213

10

trends in the bucket and ERI data over the Pacific sector relative to those over the Atlantic sector214
(Figs. 2l-o, 3i) are potentially due to differences in the types of bucket and ERI measurements215
used in each region, as implied by the differences in recruiting countries between the two sectors216
(Fig. S6, Supplemental Materials). Not surprisingly, despite recent advances (Freeman et al. 2017;217
Carella et al. 2018; Hausfather et al. 2017; Cowtan et al. 2017; Hirahara et al. 2013), it may take218
years to resolve the discrepancies between the ERI and bucket time series highlighted here.219

What is the best way forward? The recent review of SST biases by Kent et al. (2017) concludes220
with a series of recommendations for improving the reliability of historical SST bias estimations,221
especially after World War II. These include improving the metadata and volume of observations in222
the ICOADS archive, improving the classification of measurement methods from documentation223
and by analysing of data characteristics, improving the physical and statistical models used to224
estimate SST bias, and entraining more scientists into the field of SST bias adjustment. Novel225
analyses could include clustering of observations by individual ship or recruiting country, which226
may help isolate the bias variations within each measurement method. Our results make clear the227
critical importance of the recommendations in Kent et al. (2017) for improving our understanding228
of 20th century climate variability.229

APPENDIX235

Methods236
The HadSST3 data (Kennedy et al. 2011b) and night-time marine air temperature data (Kent237
et al. 2013) were obtained from the Met Office Hadley Centre (https://metoffice.gov.238
uk/hadobs). Subsequent to this study, the ERI-only and bucket-only data are also published239
on the Hadley Centre website. The unadjusted ICOADS sea-surface temperature observations240
(Woodruff et al. 2011) were obtained from the National Center for Atmospheric Research (https:241
//rda.ucar.edu/). The Japan Meteorological Agency (COBE-SST2; Hirahara et al. (2013))242
and National Climatic Data Center (ERSST4; Huang et al. (2014) and Liu et al. (2014)) sea-243
surface temperature data were both obtained from the Earth System Research Laboratory Physi-244
cal Sciences Division (https://esrl.noaa.gov/psd). To accommodate comparisons with the245
Hadley Centre data, the COBE-SST2 and ERSST4 data were (1) re-gridded onto the 5ffi*5ffi res-246
olution HadSST3 grid and (2) had their respective monthly 1961-1990 climatologies subtracted247
(to match the HadSST3 climatology period). The gridded NMAT, HadSST3, COBE-SST2, and248
ERSST4 data were matched to the spatial coverage of the co-located ERI-only and bucket-only249
data. The coordinate boundaries used for each spatial average are shown in Table A1 (grid boxes250
were weighted by the cosine of the central latitude and the ocean fraction within each box). Note251
that all data used in this study are in anomaly form with respect to the 1961-1990 base period.252

LIST OF FIGURES358
Fig. 1. Time series of sea-surface temperature anomalies (K, relative to 1961-1990) for the359 datasets and regions indicated. From top-to-bottom: (a-e) area-averages of the unadjusted
360 engine-room intake (ERI), bucket, and HadSST3 data, (f-j) area-averages of the bias adjust361 ments applied to the data, and (k-o) area-averages of the adjusted data. The North Atlantic
362 and North Pacific time series indicate averages north of 20ffiN. The shaded regions in the
363 middle and bottom rows indicate the range of all 100 realizations of the HadSST3 bias ad364 justments; the thick lines indicate the average over all 100 realizations. The time series are
365 smoothed by a centred 37-month running mean for display purposes. Note that the ERI,
366 bucket, and HadSST3 data are co-located in space (see Methods). . . . . . . . . 21

Fig. 2. Linear least-squares trends in sea-surface temperature anomalies from 1950 to 1975368 for the datasets and regions indicated. From top to bottom: (a-e) trends in the area369 averaged unadjusted data, (f-j) trends in the area-averaged bias adjustments, and (k-o) trends
370 in the area-averaged adjusted data. The North Atlantic and North Pacific trends indicate
371 averages north of 20ffiN. Thin error bars in the middle and bottom rows indicate the range
372 of trends from all 100 realizations of the HadSST3 bias adjustments. The thicker error bars
373 indicate interquartile ranges of the trends. The significance of the mean trends with respect
374 to the internal variability is given in Supplemental Materials. Note that the COBE-SST2,
375 NMAT, and ERSST4 data are co-located with the engine-room intake (ERI), bucket, and
376 HadSST3 data (see Methods). Note also that the NMAT data are only available in their
377 adjusted form. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 22

Fig. 3. Linear least-squares trends in sea-surface temperature anomalies from 1950 to 1975379 for the indicated datasets. From left-to-right: trends in the engine-room intake (ERI)
380 dataset, bucket dataset, and their differences. From top-to-bottom: (a-c) trends in the unad381 justed data, (d-f) trends in the bias adjustments (i.e., the mean of the trends calculated for
382 all 100 realizations of the HadSST3 bias adjustments), and (g-i) trends in the adjusted data.
383 Trends were not computed where fewer than 50% of the timesteps from 1950 to 1975 were
384 available. Grid boxes are stippled where the trends (g-h) and trend differences (i) have the
385 same sign across all 100 bias adjustment realizations. . . . . . . . . . . . . 23

Fig. 5. Estimating the uncertainty in the bias adjustments for the indicated regions. The or-388 ange lines represent the differences between the bucket and engine-room intake (ERI) bias
389 estimates averaged over all 100 realizations of the bias adjustments, and shading indicates
390 the range of the differences. The black lines represent the differences between the unad391 justed ERI and bucket data. The latter correspond to the ideal bias adjustments required to
392 bring the bucket and ERI data into agreement. See Eq. 3 and accompanying discussion in
393 the text. The time series are smoothed with a 12-month running mean to remove the seasonal
394 cycle from the bias adjustments (see Folland and Parker (1995)). . . . . . . . . . 25
